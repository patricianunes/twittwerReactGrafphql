# Simple Twitter Feed

May 11th seminar for Muses Code JS facilitated by **Steve Kane**

## Getting started

- In your terminal, go to your projects folder (or create one) and clone this repo `$ git clone git@github.com:steve1000/twitter.git`
- Enter directory `$ cd twitter`
- Run `$ npm install` to install project dependencies
- Add the Graphcool service ID into App.js (get this from Steve)
- Run `$ npm start`
- Start developing!

## Technology used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Methodologies used

- [Container component pattern](https://medium.com/teamsubchannel/react-component-patterns-e7fb75be7bb0)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)

## Good to know (but not essential)

- [Higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (to better understand how Apollo is injected into the component)
- ES6 features: [async/await](https://devhints.io/es6#promises), [object destructuring](https://devhints.io/es6#destructuring), [spread operator](https://devhints.io/es6#spread), [arrow functions](https://devhints.io/es6#functions), [object shorthand syntax](https://devhints.io/es6#objects-1) (I use a lot of ES6 syntax, we might need to explain to the students some of the above concepts if they haven't seen them before)
